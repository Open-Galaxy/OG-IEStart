# OG-IEStart
## Project Introduction
Open source Galaxy's IE launcher

## How it works
After starting, create a temporary file "Temp.vbs" and enter the code inside
  
CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application"). Visible=true

## Product Cons
1. It will be reported by anti-virus software when it starts.
2. Temp.vbs at runtime will not be automatically deleted after closing the program.
3. After running the program, the VBS run pop-up window will be displayed for 5-10 seconds.
